This repo contains the data used for Vizathon 2021, a competition organised by [Coronavirus Visualization team](https://understandcovid.org/). 

We used Public data provided [here](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data). 

We chose Public health Track (out of Public Health, Social Justice and Economics Tracks), and completed Challenge 2.

We aim to Visualise the Global Covid cases on monthly basis (From Jan 2020- July 2021) across the globe along with CardioVascular Diseases and Diabetes Patients, to uncover relationship among them. We also Visualize how various countries have dealt with the pandemic during these months comparing the vaccinated population and stringency measures across major countries.

We took part in a team of 2 [me](https://github.com/RaghuMadhavTiwari) and [Archita Negi](https://github.com/ArchitaN10) and used [Tableau Public ](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/).
